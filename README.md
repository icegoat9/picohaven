# PICOhaven

PICOhaven is a small tactical card-based dungeon crawler / light solo RPG for the [PICO-8 fantasy console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), inspired by the board game Gloomhaven. It adopts a modified & simplified version of the mechanics used in that game, to fit within the harsh constraints of the PICO-8 environment (only 32kB for code+graphics+sound combined, 128x128 resolution, and so on), and to streamline solo play. It includes a campaign with up to 16 scenarios, 9 character levels with multiple upgrade paths, and a set of items that provide additional customization to gameplay and strategy.

*Note: This is just a free, solo-fan-made project and has no affiliation with Gloomhaven. If you like this type of game I recommend checking out Gloomhaven (and its official video game adaptation) for a fun game with a lot of tactical depth from multi-character cooperative play!*

# Where to Play

The simplest option is on the web, on the PICO-8 BBS at: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=45105

Alternately, you can download executables from itch.io at: https://icegoat9.itch.io/picohaven (I have only tested the Mac executable so far)

You can also download the source files from this repo and load picohaven###.p8.png into the PICO-8 desktop application if you own it, on Windows/Mac/Linux/Raspberry Pi, or load that onto a PICO-8 compatible retrogaming arcade or handheld such as the [Pimoroni Picade](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picade), [Gameforce Handheld](https://gameforce.fun/products/gameforce-handheld), or other devices.

# Source Code + Development Documentation

In case it's useful to others trying to tackle something of this type on PICO-8 (and for myself in the future when I look back at this), I commented the source code and put together some supporting documentation here: [picohaven_source.md](picohaven_source.md)
