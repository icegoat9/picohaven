--storedatatocart4u.p8
--icegoat, Sep 2021
--for development of PICOhaven.p8

--store and load strings in cart memory 
-- (e.g. unused sfx/gfx space)

--for example, a single large string containing game
-- data, to be parsed with split() and similar, 
-- if a game has hit Characters or Compressed Size limits
--this does not include any data compression-- instead it's
-- focused on simple+minimal token use to extract this data

--use this cart to store data, and copy just the
-- extractgamedata4r() function to the game cart

--WARNING: will (after prompting) overwrite data in the
-- named cart, potentially overwriting existing sprite/sfx data!

function _init()
  --comment out cart_to_write to test on local cart first
